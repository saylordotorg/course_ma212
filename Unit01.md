**Unit 1: The Basics of Linear Algebra** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit serves as a review of some of the material covered in Linear
Algebra I, including linear equations, matrices, and determinants. 
Specifically, you will review properties of the real numbers and complex
numbers.  You will then learn the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which
states that every polynomial equation in one variable with complex
coefficients has at least one complex solution.  You will also review
how to solve linear systems of equations and perform operations on
matrices.  The key is to read through all the material below and
complete all the exercises in this unit.  The goal of this unit is to
ensure that you are comfortable with the key matrix algebra concepts
related to Euclidean spaces as these concepts will be referred to
throughout this course.   The skills and techniques you learn working
with matrix theory will be generalized later in the course when you work
in a more abstract linear algebra setting.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 32.5 hours to complete.
