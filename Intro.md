Course Syllabus for "MA212: Linear Algebra II"
----------------------------------------------

Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces and linear mappings between
them.  In this course, we will begin by reviewing topics you learned in
Linear Algebra I, starting with linear equations, followed by a review
of vectors and matrices in the context of linear equations.  The review
will refresh your knowledge of the fundamentals of vectors and of matrix
theory, how to perform operations on matrices, and how to solve systems
of equations.  After the review, you should be able to understand
complex numbers from algebraic and geometric viewpoints to the
fundamental theorem of algebra.  Next, we will focus on eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.  Today, these have applications in such diverse fields as
computer science (Google's PageRank algorithm), physics (quantum
mechanics, vibration analysis, etc.), economics (equilibrium states of
Markov models), and more.  We will end with the spectral theorem, which
provides a decomposition of the vector space on which operators act, and
singular-value decomposition, which is a generalization of the spectral
theorem to arbitrary matrices. Then, we will study vector spaces: real,
complex, and abstract (i.e., vector space of dimension N over an
arbitrary field K) linear transformations.  Vector spaces are structures
formed by a collection of vectors and are characterized by their
dimensions.  We will then introduce a new structure on vector spaces: an
inner product.  Inner products allow us to introduce geometric aspects,
such as length of a vector, and to define the notion of orthogonality
between vectors.  In this context, we will study the geometric aspects
of linear algebra by using Euclidean spaces as a guide.  If you
encounter a theorem that seems difficult or does not seem intuitive, try
to study that theorem in the simplest case possible and then move on to
more abstract cases.  For example, if you are uncomfortable with
abstract vector spaces (V) over an arbitrary field (K), then you can
fall back on intuition from such spaces as R and C (real and complex).
Alternatively, you can reduce the dimension of the vector spaces
involved as many notions can be understood in the two-dimensional case.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA212.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.    
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of the following
primary materials:

-   UC Davis: Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele, and Anne Schilling’s
    [*Linear Algebra: As an Introduction to Abstract
    Mathematics*](http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/index.html)
-   Brigham Young University: Kenneth Kuttler’s [*An Introduction to
    Linear
    Algebra*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Linear-Algebra-Kuttler-1-30-11-OTC.pdf)

   
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 You will also need to complete the following:  
    
 - Sub-subunit 1.1.3 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 1.1.4 Activity  
 - Subunit 1.2 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 1.3.1 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 1.3.2 Activity  
 - Subunit 1.4 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 2.1.2 Activities  
 - Subunit 2.3 Activity  
 - Subunit 2.4 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 3.1.2.1 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 3.1.2.3 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 3.1.3 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 3.2.3 Activities  
 - Subunit 3.3 Activity  
 - Subunit 3.4 Activity  
 - Sub-subunit 4.1.3 Activities  
 - Sub-subunit 4.2.4 Activities  
 - The Final Exam  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources in each unit and the activities listed
above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **117.5
hours** to complete.  This is only an approximation, and the course may
take longer to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you about 32.5
hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 11.5 hours) over three days,
for example by completing sub-subunits 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and half of 1.1.3
(a total of 4.5 hours) on Monday; the second half of sub-subunit 1.1.3
and sub-subunit 1.1.4 (a total of 5 hours) on Tuesday; and sub-subunit
1.1.5 and 1.1.6 (about 2 hours) on Wednesday; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the “Course Requirements,” Linear
Algebra I is a pre-requisite for this course.  If you are struggling
with the material as you progress through this course, consider taking a
break to revisit  [MA211 Linear
Algebra](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma211).  It will likely be
helpful to have a graphing calculator on hand for this course.  If you
do not own or have access to one, consider using this [free graphing
calculator](http://www.calculateforfree.com/graph.html).  As you read,
take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Mark down any
important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out to you. 
 These notes will serve as a useful review as you study for the Final
Exam.

    of the text, “This is a book on linear algebra and matrix theory. 
    While it is self-contained, it will work best for those who have
    already had some exposure to linear algebra.  It is also assumed
    that the reader has had calculus.  Some optional topics require more
    analysis than this, however.”  A solutions manual to the textbook is
    included.
